/**
 * Interface for all subplugins that improve the townsquare block content.
 *
 * The Plugins of the type townsquaresupport are used to increase the content of the townsquare block.
 * Every module that wants to show content on townsquare can implement this interface.
 * Every module must:
 * - gather "events" for a user that can be transformed into letters.
 * - provide php_unit test to ensure the correct behaviour.
 * local_townsquaresupport will call this function of each subplugin.
 * The townsquare block will then gather all events from local_townsquaresupport
